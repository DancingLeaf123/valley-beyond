<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> Sine 1962, StudioClassroom
has encouraged many diligent students to get up early in the
morning to study English. Studio Classroom started out as a radio
program with a printed 2-page handout, which soon developed into a
black and white twenty-page magazine. From there it expanded into a
three daily radio programs with three full-color magazines and an
accompanying English teaching television series. You can see that
Studio Classroom has changed a lot over the
years.&nbsp;<wbr> Doris Brougham, the founder of Studio
classroom magazine and also the first English teacher on the Studio
classroom radio program remembers:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> I got a tape recorder from
the United States. They were new at that time and recorded a
Chinese gossip program in my living room .I put the tape recorder
on my bicycle and took it to the radio station for
broadcast.<img STYLE="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 4px auto; WIDTH: 293px; HEIGHT: 383px; TEXT-ALIGN: center"  src ="http://s2.sinaimg.cn/orignal/4cf69ad0ea134144e9b61" ALT="Studio&nbsp;<wbr>Classroom&rsquo;s&nbsp;<wbr>45th&nbsp;<wbr>anniversary"  TITLE="Studio&nbsp;<wbr>Classroom&rsquo;s&nbsp;<wbr>45th&nbsp;<wbr>anniversary" /></P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> It is now 45 years later
and StudioClassroom is still around to help people of all ages
improve their English. In order to continue to meet the need for
everyday English conversation skills, StudioClassroom added another
magazine to its family, called let’s talk in English, in 1981.And
then in 2003 , the advanced section of StudioClassroom split off
into a new magazine to meet the needs of its high level English
readers. The three magazines continue to provide appropriate
support to learners at all levels. But StudioClassroom didn’t stop
there; it became a pioneer in its field by using different forms of
mass media to provide additional learning help. In 1997
Studioclassroom put its own TV program on the air .and it became
the first English teaching program broadcast on both radio and
television everyday. Fast forward a few years, studio classroom is
still using the latest technology; students can now use the
internet ,cell phones ,ipods ,television and of course radio to
enjoy the Studioclassroom program wherever they are. Through all
these forms of media, learners of English from all over the world
can now make use of StudioClassroom.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> As a result of its
educational excellence, Studioclassroom has won numerous awards,
including the Golden Tripod Award. These awards given to
Studioclassroom affirmed fine quality of its production.
Studioclassroom teachers, together with heavenly melody and
sunshine singers visit schools to conduct English workshops.
Through English activities music and drama, students learn to use
English in a natural way and receive a positive influence in their
lives.</P>
