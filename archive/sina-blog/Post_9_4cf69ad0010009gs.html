&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr>英语作文</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr> &nbsp;<wbr>There was a time when I
showed no interest in those reading-centered sections of our
English books. They were lengthy and boring, I always complaint.
And it seemed most of the class felt the same way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> Why? The articles showcased
there sometimes went to extremes just wanting us to see them go
solo. With no interactions between author and his readers, all I
could see in these words was a desperate attempt to force us into
accepting what he himself believes. What’s ironic, it is always
beyond us to follow an eloquent orator who lives in an exotic world
which we can hardly have any idea of.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> I was not willing to get my
mind violated this way.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> But I could not totally get
rid of them. Although I pretended to take them as meaningless
materials, there is no denying that they are all excellent in
manipulating words and expressions. They are intruders, but at the
same time, they are missionaries.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> As time passed by, I got
more and more familiar with these articles. They taught me new
phrases and new patterns; they helped me use them and practice, but
I still found myself afraid to cross the line. A voice in my heart
grew louder and louder. “Take it easy and give both of you a try”
It said.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> And finally I did. Once I
landed in the land where prejudice was swept away, I felt totally
refreshed and free. I was too stubborn before to realize how
stubborn I really was. I was locked in my little world by myself
and pleased with this “wise” strategy which actually blocked
me.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> Just a new perspective, now
I understand, and that’s all these passages want to give to me.
Take it easy to open your mind. Keep to your own mind and perceive
all the other ideas--whether they irritates you or not--as a new
perspective, and you’ll see what a difference it is destined to
make.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<wbr>&nbsp;<wbr> Now I read those articles
every possible day. They are not only my teachers, but also my best
friends. Sometimes I laugh; sometimes I fall into deep thought, but
I never get lost. I know, I am now illuminating my way, with all
these precious perspectives.</P>
